A little game I'm working on in my spare time right now, mostly just for fun. The game is using the Unity engine and I'm going to use Sculptris//Blender to create animated models. All scripts are being coded in c#.

The concept for the game is that you are a necromancer who is currently studying under your master. Your master declares they are going to take over the world, and enslave everyone. You run away from your master, vowing to stop them by first gathering your own army to take them on.

Players can either make an army of zombies using necromancy or by convincing random humans to join their cause. The player will jump to locations like how a game called FTL (Faster Than Light) played, where random events and scenes will occur. These events range from a group of evil zombies attacking the player, or the player finding a small village where they can trade and hire warriors.

Combat is done in real time. The control scheme for the player allows the player to fight with their army, as well as command it. The player can either focus on command, magic, or physical combat to resolve battle.

Not all conflicts in the game must be resolved through combat however. Players should be able to resolve a battle through other means, when available.
