Each unit under control of a wizard contributes towards a shield maybe? Like you have to defeat the wizard's army before you can face off with them directly.

Events are randomized things like in FTL. Instead of shops you find towns.
Towns obviously have shops in them, but events can also happen at towns.
Combat events are where you face another wizard or commander
Like FTL, they have access to the same equipment and what not you do
You obviously have way more health, probably better equipment, and
special upgrades

(?)Augment(?) List
	Assures at least 1 zombie will be made every combat
	Can recycle dead zombies for food
